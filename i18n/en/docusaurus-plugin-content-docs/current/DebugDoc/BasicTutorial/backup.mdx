### Connect
    * Connect the system you need to back up to the computer.
    * Open `DiskGenius.exe`.
    * If everything is normal, it will display the disk you need to back up.

### Find
    * Click the main partition on the left, then click the browse files button at the top, and finally the files will appear below.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/home.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * Find `home` and double-click to enter.
    * Once inside, usually only one folder appears, named after your system user.
    * If there are two or more, you need to determine which one contains your system configuration.
    * Double-click to enter.
    * Look for `printer_data`.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/printer-data.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * The `printer_data` folder contains your print files, Klipper configuration, Klipper logs, etc., and can be exported directly.

### Export Configuration
    * Right-click on `printer_data`, and a prompt will appear below.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/export.png').default} size="40%" align="center" />
    * Choose the directory where you want to save or export directly.
    * Confirm the export.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/export1.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * Open the exported file and find `config`, where your system configuration is stored.
        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/BasicTutorial/img/backup/export2.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * The configuration export is complete.
    * Note that the `moonraker` file should not be uploaded to other systems arbitrarily, as it may cause Klipper to fail to connect due to different systems.

# TMC 5160

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/img/5160.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />

## Basic Parameters

    * Input Voltage: 12V-24V
    * Maximum Current: 4.4A
    * Suitable for: Marlin/Klipper/RRF firmware
    * Drive Mode Support: TMC: SPI
    * Stepper/direction interface with microPlyer interpolation
    * Highest resolution is 256 microsteps
    * Supports stealthChop2 silent operation and smooth motion
    * Supports resonance suppression at mid-frequency resonance
    * Supports spreadCycle high dynamic motor control chopper
    * Supports dcStep load-dependent speed control
    * Supports stallGuard2 high precision sensorless motor load detection
    * Supports coolStep current control, up to 75% energy saving

## Mainboard Jumper Explanation

    * TMC5160 uses SPI jumpers
    * The SPI pin for the FLY drive is the fourth pin from the left on the bottom. The CS pin is the SPI pin. If the motherboard does not have the corresponding pin position, SPI cannot be used.

## TMC5160 Reference Configuration

    :::danger

    * The drive sampling resistor is `sense_resistor: 0.075`. Please do not set it incorrectly.
    * Only one of `spi_bus` and `spi_software` can be selected.

### SPI Mode Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [tmc5160 stepper_x]
    cs_pin:
    spi_bus:
    # spi_software_mosi_pin:
    # spi_software_miso_pin:
    # spi_software_sclk_pin: 
    run_current: 1.0                    # Motor operating current value
    interpolate: False                  # Whether to enable 256 microstep interpolation (enable is True, disable is False)
    sense_resistor: 0.075
    stealthchop_threshold: 0
    driver_DISS2G: 1
    driver_DISS2VS: 1
    ```

## Infinite Limit Usage Instructions

    <DIAG />

    :::tip Infinite Limit Usage Tip

    * This driver requires you to solder the DIAG pin yourself; otherwise, the infinite limit function cannot be used.
    * The original `endstop_pin:` needs to be masked or deleted, and add `endstop_pin: tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop`
    * After configuring `diag1_pin:`, the limit status refresh is not triggered.
    * You need to test a suitable value for `driver_SGT:`

    :::

    * Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [stepper_x]
    # endstop_pin:PF3
    endstop_pin: tmc5160_stepper_x:virtual_endstop
    homing_retract_dist: 0        # Retract distance should not be changed to 0 as it may cause failed homing

    [tmc5160 stepper_x]
    diag1_pin: ^!
    driver_SGT: 1

    #   After configuration, ensure that the limit status is not triggered
    #   This pin usually uses the "^" prefix to enable internal pull-up
    #   Sensitivity is related to belt tension and needs to be adjusted manually
    #  (Ensure that `driver_SGTHRS` is set to an appropriate sensitivity at the same time)

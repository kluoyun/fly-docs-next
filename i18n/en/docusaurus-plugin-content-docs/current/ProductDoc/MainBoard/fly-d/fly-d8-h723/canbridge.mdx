# CAN Bridging

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus designed for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car, thereby replacing expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol has extended its application to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, 11-bit addressing, and error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally, it required dozens of wires, but with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and simplifying the cabling process.
This chapter provides a brief overview of using CAN bridging.

## Tool Board Connecting to Motherboard via CAN

    * Please note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power supply line.

    * Please ensure that the 120Ω termination resistor is connected.

## Flashing Motherboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware flashed onto the D8 motherboard is the `USB Bridge CAN Firmware Configuration`.

# Introduction

      Fly-CM4 is fully compatible with Raspberry Pi 3B and 4B, and has been specially improved for the Raspberry Pi CM4 expansion. This expansion board provides a full set of features optimized for 3D printers. 12-24V DC power supply ensures stable power supply, which is crucial for precise control and continuous operation of 3D printers. It supports FLY-TFT and Fly-HDMI screen FPC connection functions, providing a more convenient wiring method. The CAN port allows direct CAN connection between the host machine and the slave machine, which is currently a popular method.

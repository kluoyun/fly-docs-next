# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus designed for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various components in a car, replacing the expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol has extended its application to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, provision of real-time support, transmission rates up to 1 Mb/s, along with 11-bit addressing and error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally, it required more than ten wires, but with CAN, only four wires are needed, significantly reducing the number of wires and lowering the cabling difficulty.
This chapter provides a brief overview of using CAN bridging.

## Tool Board Using CAN Connection to Motherboard

* Note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power line.

* Note that the 120Ω jumper must be connected.

## Flashing Motherboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware burned onto the Gemini motherboard is the `USB bridge CAN firmware configuration`.

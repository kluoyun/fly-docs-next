# System Image Writing to TF Card

### Preparation

    * First, install the software `Win32DiskImager`
    * Extract the system; the file name after extraction should end with `.img`
    * Insert the TF card into a card reader and plug the card reader into a USB port on your computer
    * If the TF card has data, please back it up. After writing the system, it is not recommended to remove the system card unless you need to write it to an M2WE and then can remove the TF card

### Formatting the Memory Card

    * Use the `TFFormatter.exe` software to format the TF card
    * Select the disk you want to format

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/fly-os/img/sdformatter.png').default} size="80%" align="left" />

    * Alternatively, use the built-in disk management in Windows to delete the partition. After deleting the partition, create a new partition.

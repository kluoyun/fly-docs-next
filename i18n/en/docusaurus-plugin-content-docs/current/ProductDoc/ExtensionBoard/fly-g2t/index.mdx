## Warnings

    :::warning Warning

    * When using the RS232 connection toolboard, please make sure to `share ground` with the host machine!!!!!

    :::

    * Ensure that the power supply of the host machine is turned off before installing the expansion board.
    * Avoid using the expansion board in humid or dusty environments.
    * When installing the screen, please note that the screen should not be plugged or unplugged while powered on, and pay attention to the direction of the screen cable to avoid damage.
    * When installing the fan, please pay attention to the current and voltage specifications of the fan to avoid damage.

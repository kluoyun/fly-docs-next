# CAN Bridge

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications, which can transmit signals over twisted pair cables and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car to replace expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol has extended its use to other automation and industrial applications. The characteristics of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, providing real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, and features such as 11-bit addressing and error detection.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the main board; originally requiring dozens of wires, with CAN only four wires are needed, greatly reducing the number of wires and simplifying wiring.
This chapter provides only a brief overview of using the CAN bridge.

## Tool Board Connects to Main Board via CAN

    * Note that the tool board power line is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power line.
    * Note that the 120Î© jumper must be connected.

## Flashing Main Board Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware burned on the D5 main board is the `USB Bridge CAN Firmware Configuration`

# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Notice
* Motherboard firmware burning requires flashing Klipper through Katapult
* If you are sure that the motherboard has already flashed Katapult, you do not need to perform the last step of flashing the Katapult firmware; it is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware was not successfully flashed on the motherboard
* You can quickly press the reset button twice and check if an LED on the motherboard blinks; if it does, it indicates that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware

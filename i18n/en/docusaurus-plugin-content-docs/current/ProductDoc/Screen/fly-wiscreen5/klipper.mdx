    * Connect via SSH and ensure normal internet access first.

    1. Backup the moonraker file

    ```bash
    mv ~/moonraker ~/moonraker-bak
    ```

    2. Stop the moonraker service

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart moonraker
    ```

    3. Pull the moonraker repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://e.coding.net/g-ofpa1390/3D-Printers/moonraker-dev.git -b flylcd-dev moonraker
    ```

    4. Access the host machine in the browser and add the `moonraker.conf` file, then restart the system.

    ```bash
    [network]
    ```

    5. Then enter the address below in the browser, replacing IP with the IP of the host machine.

    ```bash
    http://ip:7125/server/network/wifi/scan
    ```

* This step indicates that the operation is complete.

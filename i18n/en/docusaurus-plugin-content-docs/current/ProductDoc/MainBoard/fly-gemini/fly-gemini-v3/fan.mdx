## Reference Configuration

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]                      # FlyOS has already generated a Linux MCU for you by default, just define it to use           
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu 

    [temperature_sensor FLY-π]      # Host machine temperature
    sensor_type: temperature_host


    [temperature_fan core_fan]      # Host machine cooling fan
    pin: host:gpiochip1/gpio103     # Host machine fan pin
    max_power: 1.0
    sensor_type: temperature_host   # Set to host machine main control temperature
    control:watermark               # Control method
    target_temp: 48                 # Temperature at which the host machine cooling fan starts
    min_temp: 0                     # Minimum temperature, below which it will report an error
    max_temp: 90                    # Maximum temperature, above which it will report an error
    off_below: 0.10
    kick_start_time: 0.50
    max_speed: 0.8                  # Maximum speed, 80% of full power operation
    min_speed: 0.3                  # Minimum speed, 30% of full power operation
    ```

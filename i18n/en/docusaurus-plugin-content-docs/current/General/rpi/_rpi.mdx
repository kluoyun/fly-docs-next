## Precautions

    1. Do not plug or unplug any device except USB while powered on.
    2. The Type C interface can be used for power supply or as a USB SLAVE interface to burn images.
    3. To ensure normal CM4 power supply, do not connect other devices when burning images using the Type C interface.
    4. The module has no protection, please do not short circuit the power.
    5. FLY motherboard does not support POE function! Please do not use POE power supply.

:::danger Notice

## Download Link for Raspberry Pi Pre-installed TFTV2 System

    * System image suitable for Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+/4B/CM4/5B.
    * This image comes pre-installed with Klipper, Moonraker, Mainsail, Fulidd, Klipper-Screen, etc.

    ```bash
    https://cdn.mellow.klipper.cn/IMG/Beta/RPI-TFT-IMG-new.img.xz
    ```

## Image Download

    * Download the system by clicking [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) to download the latest released system (or as shown in the figure).
    * If downloading a torrent file, use software like Thunder or Comet to download.

    * The image with desktop and recommended software `(Raspberry Pi OS with desktop and recommended software)` is recommended for use with EMMC 16G or higher storage capacity for CM4 lite 16G memory card or above.

:::danger Notice
EMMC version needs to switch the DIP switch into CM4 burning mode while powered off, Lite version can directly burn the image to the system card.

:::danger Notice
* EMMC version needs to enter burning mode before entering, see below for instructions on how to enter burning mode.
* Lite version does not need to enter burning mode, just format and burn the image.

## Download rpiboot (Boot Loader)

    * Download and run the rpiboot software with administrator privileges by clicking [here](https://files.waveshare.net/wiki/w/upload/f/f3/Rpiboot_setup.zip).
    * Install the driver and start tool. After installation, there will be an rpiboot.exe application in the installation directory.

## Enter Burning Mode

    * Connect the computer and power the motherboard. In the computer's Device Manager, a BCMxxx device should be recognized.

    * Wait until the process ends, a U drive icon should appear on your computer.

:::danger Notice
Note: If the BCMxxx device is not recognized, one of the steps above may have gone wrong. It is essential to recognize the BCMxxx device to run rpiboot effectively; otherwise, it will be ineffective.

## Format EMMC or SD Card

    * Use SDFormatter.exe software to format the SD card by clicking [here](https://www.waveshare.net/w/upload/d/d7/Panasonic_SDFormatter.zip).

    * Alternatively, use the built-in disk management tool in Windows to delete partitions and then recreate them.
    * Right-click on This PC -> Manage -> Disk Management -> Find the newly added drive (choosing the wrong one could lead to problems) -> Delete all partitions -> Create a partition (any file system). If the drive has been used for system installation, there might be two drive icons, ignore them and proceed with formatting or deleting partitions.

## Burn Image

    1. Use Raspberry Pi Imager by clicking [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to burn the image.
    2. Before burning, configure username, password, and enable SSH.

    3. After burning, a U drive icon should appear on your computer.

## Complete Burning and Restart

    * After burning, disconnect the power, disconnect the connection to the computer, and set the BOOT switch back. Power up again.

## Precautions for Raspberry Pi Zero2 and Zero2W

    * These precautions are for using FLY-TFT screen with G2T.
    * For Raspberry Pi Zero2 and Zero2W, modify the default display device by executing the following code:
    ```cfg
    sudo sed -i 's/\/dev\/fb0/\/dev\/fb1/g' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
    ```
    * Please note that a restart is required after execution to take effect.

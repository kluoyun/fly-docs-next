# Raspberry Pi Usage Instructions

## Precautions:

    * Ensure the power is turned off before installing the expansion board.
    * Avoid using the expansion board in humid or dusty environments.
    * When installing the screen, please pay attention not to plug and unplug while powered on, and note the direction of the screen cable to avoid damage.
    * When installing the fan, please pay attention to the current and voltage specifications of the fan to avoid damage.
    * Please note that UART1 is already enabled by default and does not need to be configured in the system.
    * Please flash the latest image such as `mainsailos`, not upgrade the kernel.
    * **The Raspberry Pi can use all interfaces!**
    * **Note:** The system kernel version used by the Raspberry Pi must be greater than `5.17.x`. Use the command `uname -r` to check the kernel version.

## Download Link for Pre-installed TFTV2 System for Raspberry Pi

    * System image for Raspberry Pi Zero 2/Zero 2 W/2B/3B/3B+/4B/CM4/5B
    * This image comes pre-installed with klipper, moonraker, mainsail, fulidd, and klipper-screen.

    ```bash

## Method for Using Onboard RS232 Connection Tool

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ExtensionBoard/fly-g2t/img/rpi1.png').default} size="60%" align="left" />

    * After flashing the latest system on the Raspberry Pi, you need to edit the **config.txt file in the boot partition**.
    * Note that UART1 is already enabled by default and does not need to be configured in the system. UART3 needs to be configured as follows.
    * Add the following to the **config.txt** file:

    ```bash
    dtoverlay=uart3
    ```

    * If using UART1, the reference configuration is:

    ```cfg
    [mcu] 
    serial: /dev/ttyAMA0
    baud: 250000
    restart_method:command
    ```

    * If using UART3, the reference configuration is:

    ```cfg
    [mcu] 
    serial: /dev/ttyAMA1
    baud: 250000
    restart_method:command
    ```

## Usage of Onboard 5V Fan

    * If you need to control devices via the 40-pin GPIO on the Raspberry Pi, follow the Klipper tutorial for installation <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://www.klipper3d.org/zh/RPi_microcontroller.html?h=rpi">RPi Microcontroller</Button>

## Screen Usage Methods

    * GitHub address <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://github.com/kluoyun/FLY-TFT">FLY-TFT</Button>

### 1. Introduction

    FLY-TFT-V2 is a TFT LCD screen based on st7796, supporting both capacitive and resistive touch, with a resolution of 320x480, using SPI interface.

### 2. System Installation

    :::tip

    * Note: The system kernel version used by the Raspberry Pi must be greater than `5.17.x`. Use the command `uname -r` to check the kernel version.
    * Flash the latest image such as `mainsailos`, not upgrade the kernel.
    * You need to install it yourself <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="https://klipperscreen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation/">KlipperScreen</Button>

    :::

    * Install the latest **MainsailOS** using [Raspberry Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
        * Download and install [Raspberry Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
        * Open **Raspberry Imager**
        * Click **CHOOSE DEVICE**
        * Select the corresponding model according to your device
        * Click **CHOOSE OS**
        * Choose **Other specific-purpose OS**
        * Choose **3D printing**
        * Choose **Mainsail OS**
        * Choose the latest version. If your settings support 64-bit systems, choose **rpi64**
        * Click **CHOOSE STORAGE**
        * Select your storage device, such as an SD card
        * Click **NEXT**, wait for the installation to complete

### 4. Driver Installation

    * Install the FLY-TFT-V2 driver
    
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/kluoyun/FLY-TFT.git
        cd FLY-TFT
        sudo chmod +x ./scripts/install.sh
        ./scripts/install.sh
        ```
        
    

### 5. Usage

    :::tip

    * Touch requires enabling I2C support, the corresponding configuration is `dtparam=i2c_arm=on`

    :::

    1. After installing the driver, add the `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2` overlay to the config.txt file.
    2. Open `/boot/config.txt` (for bookworm systems, it is `/boot/firmware/config.txt`)
        ```bash
        sudo nano /boot/config.txt
        ```
    3. At the end of the file, add the following configuration
        ```bash
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2
        ```
    * By default, the screen displays horizontally at 90 degrees. If you need to rotate the screen, use the following configuration
        ```bash
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r90  # Same as default orientation, horizontal
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r270 # 270 degrees horizontal, flipped
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r0   # 0 degrees vertical, vertical
        dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r180 # 180 degrees vertical, flipped
        ```
        * Only one configuration can be added, multiple configurations cannot be added.
        * Under normal circumstances, the TFT touch direction will automatically follow the display direction without modifying the touch configuration in the system.

    4. After adding the configuration at the end of the file, execute the command `sudo reboot` to restart the system.

        * Make sure hardware connections are correct.
        * The driver has been installed.
        * The `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2` overlay has been added to the `/boot/config.txt` (for bookworm systems, it is `/boot/firmware/config.txt`) file.
        * Some systems may have the default fb0 device, and the FLY-TFT will be assigned to the fb1 device. You need to enable the fb1 device by modifying the configuration file.
        * Execute the command `ls /dev/fb*` to view the devices. If two devices, fb0 and fb1, appear, execute the following command to enable the fb1 device (by default, it is fb0).
        * Execute the following command to modify the default configuration to use fb1 device
            ```bash
            sudo sed -i 's/\/dev\/fb0/\/dev\/fb1/g' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
            ```

### 6. Using KlipperScreen

    * MainsailOS does not come with KlipperScreen installed by default, it needs to be installed manually.
    * Refer to [KlipperScreen](https://github.com/KlipperScreen/KlipperScreen) or use [kiauh](https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh) to install.
    * If KlipperScreen is successfully installed and step 5 has been completed correctly, you should see the KlipperScreen interface at this point.

### 7. All Available Configurations

    * `speed` **Requires parameter**: Set the maximum SPI clock frequency for the TFT, in Hz, default 96000000 (if severe screen artifacts occur, reduce this value appropriately)
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,speed=80000000` 

    * `r0/r90/r180/r270` **Optional**: Set the display and touch direction of the TFT, default is 90 degrees, available values are 0, 90, 180, 270 (only one configuration can be set)
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r90` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,r180`

    * `disable_touch` **No parameter required**: Disable the touch function of the TFT, default is enabled
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,disable_touch`

    * `invx`,`invy` **No parameter required**: Set the touch direction of the TFT, `invx` flips the X direction, `invy` flips the Y direction
    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invx` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invy` or `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,invx,invy`

    * `swapxy` **No parameter required**: Set the touch direction of the TFT, swap the X and Y axes, i.e., horizontal orientation
        * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,swapxy`
    
    :::tip

    * **Note:** All parameters can be set simultaneously (optional parameters can only choose one), separate parameters with commas, only one line of configuration is allowed.
    * **Warning:** Under normal conditions, only `r0`, `r90`, `r180`, `r270` are used, other parameters are used only in special cases, especially `invx`, `invy`, `swapxy`.

    :::

    * Example: `dtoverlay=fly-tft-v2,speed=80000000,r270`


## Precautions for Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and Zero 2 W

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/ExtensionBoard/fly-g2t/img/zero.png').default} size="60%" align="left" />
    * These precautions are for the instructions when using the FLY-TFT screen with G2T.
    * For Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and Zero 2 W, you need to modify the default display device by executing the code below directly, otherwise, it will not display.
    * Note that you need to restart after execution to use.

    ```bash
    sudo sed -i 's/\/dev\/fb0/\/dev\/fb1/g' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
    ```

# Main Board Precautions

## Power Indicator

    * When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting other main board power, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
    * After connecting the main board power, the main board power light should be on for `3.3V`, `5V`, and `VCC`.

### Troubleshooting

    :::danger Note

    * Without any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * At least two LEDs, `3.3V` and `5V`, should remain lit when powered only through TYPE-C.

    :::

    * If no lights are on, it indicates a short circuit, and you need to contact customer service.
    * If one of the lights `3.3V` or `5V` is blinking, it also indicates a short circuit, and you need to contact customer service.

## Drivers

    * The main board supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Ports

    * Pay attention to the wiring sequence. For three-wire limit switches, if 5V, GND, and S are connected incorrectly, it may cause damage to the main board.
    * If two wires are directly connected to S and GND, it is fine.
    * For PL08 and other proximity switches, an external diode must be connected to the signal port to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V.

## Firmware

    * Due to button issues, the tutorial has been updated to use Katapult firmware for firmware flashing.
    * It is recommended to use a computer for flashing Katapult firmware, and then use the Katapult firmware to flash Klipper.

2. Select `Klipper` for `Printer Type`.
3. Enter the IP address of the klipper machine in `Moonraker IP`.
4. Enter the port of the klipper host in `Moonraker Port`. The default is `7125`. If the host uses other ports, you need to enter the corresponding port yourself.
5. Ignore `Apikey`. It is not supported for the time being.

8. If the connection fails:
    - Check if the IP address and port are correct.
    - Check if the printer and AirClick are connected to the same network.
    - Check if the klipper host is running normally.
    - Check if the browser can open the web page of the klipper host.

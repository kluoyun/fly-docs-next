# BL Firmware

    :::tip

    * Please note that the `bootloader` has already been pre-flashed at the factory and does not need to be re-flashed.

    :::
## Entering Programming Mode


    * There are two methods to enter programming mode.
    * The first method: With the motherboard completely powered off, short the BOOT pin and connect the data transfer cable to the motherboard and your device.
    * The second method: Connect the data transfer cable to the motherboard and your device, then short the BOOT pin and press the RST button, release the RST button, and finally disconnect the shorted BOOT jumper.

            4. Flashing Firmware

            :::tip

            Only one firmware needs to be flashed.

            :::

            * Below is the firmware flashing command
                ```bash
                sudo dfu-util -a 0 -d 0483:df11 --dfuse-address 0x08000000 -D ~/FLY_Katapult/BL/SUPER/SUPER8PRO.bin
                ```

            5. When the following content appears as shown by the arrow ``File downloaded successfully``, the flashing is successful.

            :::tip

            After flashing, the motherboard needs to be completely powered off once.

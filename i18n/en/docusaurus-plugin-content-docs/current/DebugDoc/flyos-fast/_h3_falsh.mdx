# System Image Burning

## System Introduction
FlyOS-Fast is a lightweight Linux system customized specifically for 3D printing, supporting the entire series of Fly mainboards. Its features include:

- Fast boot, kernel optimization ensures Klipper real-time performance
- Optimized file system reduces the risk of failure to start due to power loss
- 30-second quick startup of KlipperScreen
- Pre-installed services including Klipper, RRF, Mainsail, Fluidd, Moonraker, and KlipperScreen
- Support for switching between Klipper and RRF systems
- Support for online one-click switching between Mainsail and Fluidd
- Support for USB printing, power-off resume printing, and serial port screen
- Support for automatic firmware burning on startup (fly-c8, fly-geminiv3)
- Allows pre-setting default language and printer name for front-end UIs like Fluidd

For more OEM customization options (such as setting custom boot logos, preset configuration files, or hiding Mainsail tabs), please contact us.

:::tip Note
This is a lightweight customized system. The built-in components such as klipper are not official versions and do not support user modifications or upgrades.

- The system account for FLYOS-FAST is `root`, with the password `mellow`.


## System Burning Preparation

1. Prepare the required devices

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="usb" label="If using a TF card to boot the system, prepare the following equipment" default>
        - Card reader
        - A TF card with a capacity of 16GB-128GB, with a transmission speed of Class10 or higher.
        - It is recommended to use high-quality TF cards from brands such as Kingston, SanDisk, Samsung, and Kioxia; avoid using low-quality TF cards!
        - Windows PC (Windows 7, 10, and 11 are all supported)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="can" label="If using M2WE to boot the system, prepare the following equipment">
        - M2WE (FLY proprietary device)
        - M2SD (FLY burning device)
        - Windows PC (Windows 7, 10, and 11 are all supported)
        - Installation diagram

</Tabs>


2. Download the FLY-H3 system image: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="https://g-ofpa1390.coding.net/public-artifacts/3D-Printers/flyos-fast/packages">H618 system image</Button>
    :::tip
    - The naming rule for system files is: `FlyOS-Fast-[chip series]-[version number].img`, e.g., `FlyOS-Fast-H618-v1.0.0.img`
    - For Windows systems, download the `.exe` file, which is a 7z self-extracting archive. After downloading, double-click to open and extract to get the `.img` file (this can only be extracted using a Windows system).
    - For other systems like MacOS and Linux, download the `.7z` file, which is a 7z archive. After downloading, use a tool that supports 7z format to extract and obtain the `.img` file.
    - Due to the large size of the system files, other compression formats and source images are temporarily unavailable.
    - This tutorial will introduce using the `.exe` file as an example.
    :::
    - Access the FlyOS-Fast artifact repository, select the compression format, and enter the file page
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl1.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Select the image version (default latest)
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl2.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Click `File List`, then click the scrollbar, drag it to the right, and the download button will appear.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl3.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Click the download button to download the system image.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl4.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />


3. Extract the system image file to get the `.img` file.
    - Double-click or right-click to open `FlyOS-Fast-H618.exe`, wait a few seconds, and a window will pop up (if the system prompts that it is unsafe, choose "More information" -> "Run").
    - You can choose the extraction directory, then click the `Extract` button, and wait for the extraction to complete.
    
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/ext1.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

    - After extraction, a `FlyOS-Fast-H618-vx.x.x.img` file will be generated in the extraction directory. `x.x.x` is the system version number.


4. Install the device to be burned onto the computer.


## Burning the System

1. Open Rufus, select the device, and ensure the selected device shows the correct capacity matching the inserted burn card.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

2. Choose the `Boot type`, which defaults to `Image file`.
3. Select the image file by clicking the `Select` button next to the `Boot type selection`, and choose the `.img` file after extraction.
4. After selecting the image file, the `Boot type selection` will change to the filename of the image file.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash2.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

5. Click the `Start` button. If a popup appears asking to clear disk data, click `OK`.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash3.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />

6. After burning, the computer will emit a prompt sound, and the progress bar will display as `Ready`.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash4.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

7. Do not remove the burn card immediately after burning.
8. Open File Explorer to check if there is a named `FlyOS-Conf` USB drive or removable disk.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash5.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

9. Open `FlyOS-Conf`. If the two files shown in the image below exist, it indicates successful burning.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash6.webp').default} size="70%" align="center" />

10. Install the system card onto the motherboard.

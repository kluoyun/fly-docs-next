    * SHT36 LIS3DH comes with pre-flashed CAN-connected Katapult firmware at a rate of 1M
    * SHT36 LIS3DH CAN-connected Katapult firmware has rates of 500K and 1M; users can flash it themselves if needed

# Firmware Burning Instructions

    * SHT36 LIS3DH can only connect to the host machine via CAN
    * CAN needs to be connected using `XT30(2+2)-F`
    * Below is the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable style

:::danger Notice
* Mainboard firmware burning requires flashing Klipper through Katapult
* If the mainboard is confirmed to have flashed Katapult, there is no need to perform the final Katapult firmware burning; this is just a precaution in case the mainboard's Katapult firmware was not successfully flashed
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if an LED on the mainboard is blinking; if it is, it indicates that the mainboard has entered Katapult firmware

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * SHT36 LIS3DH can connect to the host machine using the following methods
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware Burning</Button>
        * Advantage: If you flash the `Katapult` firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the motherboard and it supports bus connections
        * Disadvantage: Using `KlipperScreen` together may cause errors such as homing timeout
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, ensure that the host machine supports CAN and that it is paired with UTOC or a motherboard flashed with bridge firmware

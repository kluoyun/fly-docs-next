# User Guide

## Precautions

    * You must connect to the internet when using for the first time. If your Wi-Fi cannot access the internet, halo will not be able to obtain the initial configuration.
    * All settings in the settings page will only take effect after the device restarts following a click on **Save Settings**.
    * The blockage detection feature is disabled by default. After enabling it in the settings and restarting the device, you can enter it by swiping up from the home screen.
    * The shutdown function after printing is completed is disabled by default and can be enabled in the settings.
    * All buttons in pop-ups that require canceling or pausing printing must be long-pressed; single clicks are ineffective (to prevent accidental touches).
    * In the system services page, the Host service is the master computer.
    * When using the official firmware, do not attempt to replace the main control chip or FLASH chip.

    :::tip

    * Note: If your `moonraker.conf` configuration file exceeds 4MB, you may not be able to use it normally. If there are any abnormalities, reduce the size of the `moonraker.conf` configuration file.

    :::

## System Firmware Update

    * There are two types of updates for the halo version: full updates and OTA incremental updates.
        * Full update: Larger upgrades involving the underlying system, requiring the use of a USB stick to burn the full firmware package.
        * Incremental update: Normal OTA upgrade, check for updates in the device information page.

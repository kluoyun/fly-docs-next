    :::tip

    * The SHT36 V3 comes with a Katapult firmware pre-flashed for the CAN connection at a rate of 1M.
    * The Katapult firmware for the SHT36 V3 CAN connection supports rates of 500K and 1M; if needed, it can be flashed manually.

# Firmware Burning Instructions
    
    * Both firmware compilation and firmware burning require the use of an upper-level computer.
    * The SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper-level computer via RS232 or CAN.
    * RS232 and CAN need to use `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection.
    * Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable:

:::danger Note
* The mainboard firmware must be burned through Katapult to burn Klipper.
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has already been burned with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final Katapult firmware burning; this is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware burning on the mainboard was unsuccessful.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if a LED on the mainboard flashes. If so, it indicates that the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * The SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper-level computer in the following ways:
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware</Button>
        * Advantage: If the `Katapult` firmware is flashed, the firmware can be updated without touching the motherboard, and it supports bus connections.
        * Disadvantage: It may cause errors such as homing timeouts when used together with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, ensure that the upper-level computer supports CAN and pair it with UTOC or a motherboard with bridge firmware installed.
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware</Button>
        * Advantage: No special software is required; communication is reliable and stable.
        * Disadvantage: To update the firmware, you need to enter manual DFU mode or double-click RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware.
        * Tip: A G2T or UTOR is required to use this.

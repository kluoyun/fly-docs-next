# I2C Usage

    * Use the I2C interface of the 40PIN PC
    * This tutorial uses the FLY-PI V2LM75 I2C sensor with I2C2 as an example!!!
    * Please note that I2C1 cannot be used if it is already occupied by other devices!!!
    * Please ensure that the wiring is secure and stable!!!

## Open I2C via FLY Tools

    * Find Overlays and select i2c2 and i2c0 at the back
    * Please note that I2C1 cannot be used if it is already occupied by other devices!!!
    * Save and restart

## Wiring and Search
    * This tutorial uses PI V2 as a reference
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/img/i2c2.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />

    * After connecting to the FLY PC via SSH, enter the following command to output the content below
    * If using `I2C0`, replace the `2` in the command below with `0`

    ```cfg
    sudo i2cdetect -y -r 2
    ```

<ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/SBC/fly-pi-v2/img/i2c1.png').default} size="80%" align="center" />

    * Please note that if everything is normal, the content above will appear immediately after pressing Enter, including an address
    * Please note that the address is random
    * Please note that if the wiring is incorrect, the wires are reversed, the configuration is not opened, or the module is damaged, the output will be abnormal
    * The address needs to be converted from hexadecimal to decimal before filling it into the `i2c_address:` field in the configuration
    * You can use an online base converter in a browser to perform the conversion

## Configuration

    ```cfg
    [mcu host]
    serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu

    [temperature_sensor my_sensor]
    sensor_type: LM75
    i2c_address:72
    # #   Default is 72 (0x48). Normal range is 72-79 (0x48-0x4F) and the 3
    # #   low bits of the address are configured via pins on the chip
    # #   (usually with jumpers or hard wired).
    i2c_mcu:host
    i2c_bus:i2c.2
    # i2c_software_scl

    ```

# Main Board Precautions

## Power Indicator

    * When powered only by TYPE-C and not connected to other main board power, at least two lights `3.3V` and `5V` should be on.
    * After connecting the main board power, the main board power light should light up `3.3V`, `5V`, and `12V`.
    * Only after the drive power 0-2, drive power 3-7, and hotbed power are connected, will the power indicator lights on the lower left of the main board light up normally.

### Troubleshooting


    :::danger Note

    * With no external devices connected (drives, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * When powered only by TYPE-C, at least two LEDs, `3.3V` and `5V`, should remain constantly on.

    :::

    * If `3.3V` and `5V` do not light up, check the main board's 5V jumper.
    * If the issue persists after replacing the jumper and confirming that the type-c is supplying power normally, contact customer service for after-sales support.
    * If one of the lights `3.3V`, `5V`, or `12V` is blinking, it indicates a chip short circuit; contact customer service for after-sales support.

## Drive

    * Pay attention to the drive power, which is divided into two circuits: the first circuit powers drives 3-7, and the second circuit powers 0-2.
    * The main board supports external drives     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Port

    * Except for the last drive port (Drive7), which has an infinite limit switch jumper, all other drive ports have their infinite limit switch directly connected to the limit switch port.
    * If the limit switch port does not work, you can replace the limit switch port or trim the infinite limit switch foot of the drive.

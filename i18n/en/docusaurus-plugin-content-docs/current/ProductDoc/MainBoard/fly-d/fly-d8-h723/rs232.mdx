# RS232 Connection

The RS232 standard interface (also known as EIA RS-232) is one of the commonly used serial communication interface standards, widely applied in data transmission between various devices. Its stability and reliability make it a preferred communication method for many devices. The protocol uses signal voltage levels different from standard 5V to transmit wire data, which can minimize signal interference to the greatest extent. In 3D printer systems, RS232 has higher data transmission rates, better stability, simpler configuration, and better compatibility with host computers compared to CAN.

## Using RS232 Connection for Tool Board to Connect to Main Board

* Please note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the RS232 signal line but to the 12V-24V power supply line.

* No recompilation of the D8 mainboard firmware is required.

1. Install the flashing tool

    * Enter the following command in SSH
    * Only execute this for the first flashing, no need to run it again after that
    ```bash
    cd ~/klipper/lib/rp2040_flash/ && make
    ```
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/dfu-flash/img/2040.png').default} size="100%" align="left" />

2. Execute the following command to check if the connection is successful.


    * Enter `lsusb`
    * If there is no `2e8a:0003` device, please try to re-enter **flashing mode**
    * Due to system version issues, it may display other names. If there is a `2e8a:0003`, it indicates that the flashing mode has been entered.

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/General/get-id/img/2e8a.png').default} size="80%" align="left" /> 

    :::warning Note

    Only proceed if there is a `2e8a:0003`.

3. Pull the pre-compiled firmware

    * These are all pre-compiled firmwares
    * Please note that the host machine needs to be able to access the internet to install
    * The host machine needs to execute the following command to download the firmware package

    ```bash
    cd && git clone https://github.com/FengHua741/FLY_Katapult.git
    ```

    * If you have already downloaded the firmware package, it is recommended to update the firmware package before proceeding with the remaining steps

    cd ~/FLY_Katapult && git pull
    ```

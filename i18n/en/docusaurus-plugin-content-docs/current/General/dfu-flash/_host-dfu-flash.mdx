    1. Install the flashing tool

    * No need to install the flashing tool for the FLY GUI.
    * If you need to install it, please note: The GUI needs to be connected to the internet to install properly.
    * If you have already installed it, no need to install again.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install dfu-util -y
    ```

    2. Execute the following command to check if the connection is successful.

    ```bash
    lsusb
    ```

    * If there is no DFU device, please try to re-enter **flashing mode**.
    * Due to system version issues, other names may be displayed. If `0483:df11` is shown, it indicates that the flashing mode has been entered.

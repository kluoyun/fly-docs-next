# CAN Bridging

CAN bus is a serial communication protocol bus used for real-time applications, which can transmit signals using twisted-pair wires and is one of the most widely used field buses in the world. The CAN protocol is used for communication between various different components in a car, replacing the expensive and cumbersome wiring harnesses. The robustness of this protocol extends its use to other automation and industrial applications. Features of the CAN protocol include complete serial data communication, providing real-time support, transmission rates up to 1Mb/s, with 11-bit addressing and error detection capabilities.
On 3D printers, CAN bus is used to reduce the number of wires connecting the print head to the motherboard. Originally requiring dozens of wires, only four wires are needed with CAN, significantly reducing the number of wires and lowering the wiring difficulty.
This chapter provides a brief overview of using CAN bridging.

## Tool Board Connecting to Mainboard via CAN

    * Note that the power line of the tool board is not connected to the CAN port but to the 12V-24V power line
    
    * Note that the 120Ω jumper must be connected

## Flashing Mainboard Firmware

* Ensure that the firmware burned onto the D7 motherboard is the `USB Bridge CAN Firmware Configuration`

## System Image File Name Explanation

* The naming rule for system files is: `FlyOS-Fast-[chip series]-[version number].img`, e.g., `FlyOS-Fast-H5-v1.0.0.img`.
* The source file is in `.img` format. Only `.exe` and `.7z` compressed files are provided in the download link for convenience.
* Windows users can download the `.exe` file, which is a 7z self-extracting archive. After downloading, double-click to open and extract to get the `.img` file (this can only be extracted using Windows).
* Users of other systems such as MacOS or Linux can download the `.7z` file, which is a 7z compressed package. After downloading, use a tool that supports the 7z format to extract and obtain the `.img` file.
* Due to the large size of the system files, other compression formats and the original image files are temporarily unavailable for download.

:::tip System Selection

* fly-C5, products using the Allwinner H618 chip, select `FlyOS-Fast-H618.exe` or `FlyOS-Fast-H618.7z`.
* fly-pi series, fly-c8 series, fly-gemini series, etc., all products using the Allwinner H5 chip, select `FlyOS-Fast-H5.exe` or `FlyOS-Fast-H5.7z`.
* fly-pi-lite2 series, fly-miniPad series, etc., all products using the Allwinner H3 chip, select `FlyOS-Fast-H3.exe` or `FlyOS-Fast-H3.7z`.
* The chip models are different, so are the system files. Please choose according to the actual situation.

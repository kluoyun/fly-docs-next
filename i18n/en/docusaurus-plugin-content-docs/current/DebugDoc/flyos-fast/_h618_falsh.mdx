# System Image Burning

## System Introduction
FlyOS-Fast is a lightweight Linux system customized specifically for 3D printing, supporting the entire series of Fly host platforms. Its features include:

- Fast boot, kernel optimization ensures Klipper real-time performance
- File system optimization reduces the risk of failing to start due to power failure
- 30-second quick startup of KlipperScreen
- Pre-installed services such as Klipper, RRF, Mainsail, Fluidd, Moonraker, and KlipperScreen
- Support for switching between Klipper and RRF systems
- Support for online one-click switching between Mainsail and Fluidd
- Support for USB disk printing, power-off resume printing, and serial port screen
- Support for automatic firmware burning on startup (fly-c8, fly-geminiv3)
- Allows pre-setting default language and printer name for front-end UIs like Fluidd

For more OEM customization features (such as setting up custom startup logos, preset configuration files, hiding Mainsail tabs, etc.), please contact us.

:::tip Notice
This system is a lightweight customized system; the built-in components like klipper are not official versions and do not support user modifications or upgrades.
:::

- The system account for FLYOS-FAST is `root`, with the password being `mellow`.


## System Burning Preparation

1. Prepare the required devices

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="usb" label="If using a TF card to boot the system, prepare the following devices" default>
        - Card reader
        - One TF card with a capacity of 16GB-128GB, with a transmission speed of Class10 or higher.
        - It is recommended to use TF cards from reputable brands such as Kingston, SanDisk, Samsung, and Kioxia; avoid using generic TF cards!
        - A Windows PC (Windows 7, Windows 10, or Windows 11)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="can" label="If using M2WE to boot the system, prepare the following devices">
        - M2WE (FLY proprietary device)
        - M2SD (FLY burn-in device)
        - A Windows PC (Windows 7, Windows 10, or Windows 11)
        - Installation diagram

</Tabs>

2. Download the FLY-H618 system image: <Button variant="contained" disableElevation component="a" rel="noopener" href="https://g-ofpa1390.coding.net/public-artifacts/3D-Printers/flyos-fast/packages">H618 system image</Button>
    :::tip
    - The naming rule for the system file is: `FlyOS-Fast-[chip series]-[version number].img`, for example: `FlyOS-Fast-H618-v1.0.0.img`
    - For Windows systems, download the `.exe` file, which is a 7z self-extracting compression package. After downloading, double-click it to extract and obtain the `.img` file (only Windows systems can be used to extract).
    - For other systems such as MacOS or Linux, download the `.7z` file, which is a 7z compression package. After downloading, use tools that support the 7z format to extract and obtain the `.img` file.
    - Due to the large size of the system file, other compression formats and source images are temporarily unavailable for download.
    - This tutorial uses the `.exe` format for introduction.
    :::
    - Access the FlyOS-Fast artifact repository, select the compression format, and enter the file page.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl1.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Select the image version (default latest).
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl2.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Click "File List," then scroll the bar to the right to display the download button.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl3.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />
    - Click the download button to download the system image.
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-c/fly-c5/img/flyos-fast_dl4.webp').default} size="90%" align="center" />


3. Extract the system image file to get the `.img` file.
    - Double-click or right-click open `FlyOS-Fast-H618.exe`, and after a few seconds, a window will pop up (if the system prompts it is unsafe, choose "More Info" -> "Run").
    - You can choose the extraction directory, then click the `Extract` button, wait for the extraction to complete.
    
    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/ext1.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

    - After extraction, a `FlyOS-Fast-H618-vx.x.x.img` file will be generated in the extraction directory. `x.x.x` is the system version number.


4. Install the device to be burned onto the computer.


## Burn the System

1. Open Rufus, select the device, and ensure the selected device shows the same capacity as the burning card inserted into the computer.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash1.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

2. Choose the "Boot type," which defaults to selecting "Image file."
3. Select the image file by clicking the "Select" button next to the "Boot type selection."
4. After selecting the image file, the "Boot type selection" will change to the filename of the image file.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash2.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

5. Click the `Start` button; if a pop-up window appears prompting to clear disk data, click `OK`.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash3.webp').default} size="50%" align="center" />

6. After burning, the computer will emit a prompt sound, and the progress bar will show as `Ready`.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash4.webp').default} size="30%" align="center" />

7. Do not rush to remove the burning card after completion.
8. Open File Explorer to check if there is a U-drive or removable disk named `FlyOS-Conf`.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash5.webp').default} size="60%" align="center" />

9. Open `FlyOS-Conf`; if the two files shown in the figure below exist, it indicates successful burning.

    <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/DebugDoc/flyos-fast/img/flash6.webp').default} size="70%" align="center" />

10. Install the system card onto the motherboard.

    * When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting other motherboard power, at least two lights should be on: `3.3V` and `5V`.
    * After connecting to the motherboard power, the motherboard power light should be on for `3.3V`, `5V`, and `VCC`.

### Troubleshooting


    :::danger Notice

    * In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * When powered only through TYPE-C, at least the `3.3V` light should remain constantly on.

    :::

    * If the `5V` light does not turn on after connecting the motherboard power and driver power, contact customer service for after-sales support.

## Driver

    * The motherboard supports an external driver     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Tutorial</Button>

## Limit Switch Port

    * Please pay attention to the wiring sequence. For three-wire limit switches, note that if 5V, GND, and S are connected incorrectly, it may lead to motherboard damage.
    * If two wires are directly connected, S and GND are sufficient.
    * PL08 and other proximity switches require an additional diode to reduce the voltage to below 3.3V at the signal port.

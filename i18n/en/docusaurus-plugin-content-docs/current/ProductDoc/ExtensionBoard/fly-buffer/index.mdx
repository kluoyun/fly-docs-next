# Introduction

# LLL Buffer Usage

​	The LLL consumable buffer is a device specifically designed for remote filament feeding in 3D printers, aiming to simplify the loading and unloading of filaments. The buffer is equipped with two buttons, one for feeding and the other for retracting, allowing users to perform electric feeding and retracting operations.

### Buffer Function:

​	When the extruder of the 3D printer is feeding, if there is pulling on the filament spool at the far end, the buffer will detect this action and automatically feed a segment of filament towards the hot end. This operation will be repeated each time there is pulling. This effectively reduces the pulling force on the filament by the extruder, maintaining stable pushing force and thus improving the stability of print quality.

### Filament Runout Detection Function:

​	The buffer has a built-in filament runout detector. When it detects that there is no filament in the buffer, it sends a signal to the 3D printer to pause printing. To use this function, you need to connect the signal pin and modify the configuration of the 3D printer. However, the buffer function can be used directly without modifying the configuration.

​	With the above design features, the LLL consumable buffer not only simplifies filament operations but also enhances the stability of the 3D printing process and print quality.

* Please note that you need to connect the filament before using these functions; otherwise, you can only control the motor through the buttons.

    * Ensure the host machine can connect to the internet normally.
    * Ensure the data cable connecting the lower-level machine to the host machine has data transmission capabilities.
    * After SSH connecting to the host machine, enter `lsusb` and press enter. One of the following three situations may occur:
        * Displays USB devices that have been recognized.
        * Prompts that there is no `ls` command, you can execute this command to install it:
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install usbutils
            ```
        * No error message, no other information (a system issue requires replacing the system).
    * If there is no reaction after entering `lsusb`, this is a system issue and cannot be resolved here; you need to replace a confirmed normal system.
    * If the information circled in the image below appears, you can proceed to the next step.

    * `0843:df11` belongs to the device you will use this time. Ignore the subsequent prompts as system issues may cause them to display incompletely or not at all.
    * If not, check whether the data cable is properly connected or if the motherboard has entered DFU.

    :::warning Note

    Proceed to the next step only if you have `0843:df11`.

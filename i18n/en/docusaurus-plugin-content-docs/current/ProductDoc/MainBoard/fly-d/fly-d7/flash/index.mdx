# Firmware Burning Instructions

:::danger Notice
* Board firmware burning needs to be done through Katapult to flash Klipper.
* If you are sure that the board already has Katapult flashed, you do not need to perform the final step of flashing the Katapult firmware; it is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware on the board was not flashed successfully.
* You can quickly press the reset button twice to see if an LED on the board blinks, indicating that the board has entered Katapult firmware.

## Introduction
#### Logic Folder
* We do 99% of our UI coding in the logic folder; other folders need not be concerned.
* gcodeLogic.cc is similar to main.c; 99% of the UI code exists here, and other files need not be given much attention.

#### i18n Folder
* Stores translation tables for various countries.

#### Resources Folder
* Stores image resources used by the UI.

#### UI Folder
* Stores UI interface files; double-clicking opens them.
* Double-clicking the "eye" icon pointed to by the arrow in the lower left corner can open hidden interfaces.

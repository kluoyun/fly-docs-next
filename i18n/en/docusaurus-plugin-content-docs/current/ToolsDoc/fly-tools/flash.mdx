    * Supports one-click copy of device ID, automatically recognizes the ID and adds **serial:** , **canbus_uuid:** , **device:** in front of the corresponding configuration
    * Supports modification of CAN speed and CAN buffer, allowing players to customize CAN easily
    * Supports camera device query, avoiding the trouble of players searching for cameras

    :::tip Tip

    * Please note that FLY-Tools will not automatically create CAN configurations; you need to create CAN configurations yourself to use CAN speed and CAN buffer modification

    :::

    * Please provide SSH network connection to your user and execute the following command
    * This feature is temporarily not supported on Ubuntu

    ```bash
    sudo /bin/sh -c "cat > /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0" << EOF
    allow-hotplug can0
    iface can0 can static
        bitrate 1000000
        up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024
        pre-up ip link set can0 type can bitrate 1000000
        pre-up ip link set can0 txqueuelen 1024

    * The SHT36 V3 is shipped with the Katapult firmware pre-flashed on the CAN port at a rate of 1M.
    * The Katapult firmware for the CAN port of the SHT36 V3 has rates of 500K and 1M; you can flash it yourself if needed.

# Firmware Burning Instructions
    
    * Both firmware compilation and firmware burning require the use of an upper-level computer.
    * The SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper-level computer via RS232 or CAN.
    * RS232 and CAN need to use `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection.
    * Below is the appearance of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable:

:::danger Note
* The mainboard firmware must be flashed via Katapult to burn Klipper.
* If it is confirmed that the mainboard has already been flashed with Katapult, there is no need to perform the final Katapult firmware burning, as this is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware burn was unsuccessful.
* You can quickly press reset twice to see if a LED on the mainboard flashes. If so, it indicates that the mainboard has entered the Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * The SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper-level computer using the following methods:
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware</Button>
        * Advantage: If the `Katapult` firmware is flashed, you can update the firmware without touching the motherboard, and it supports bus connections.
        * Disadvantage: May cause errors such as homing timeout when used with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, ensure your upper-level computer supports CAN and it needs to be paired with UTOC or a motherboard with bridge firmware installed.
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware</Button>
        * Advantage: No special software is required, communication is reliable and stable.
        * Disadvantage: Re-flashing the firmware requires entering manual DFU or double-clicking RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware.
        * Tip: It needs to be paired with G2T or UTOR to work.

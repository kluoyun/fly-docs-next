# 1. Product Introduction

FLY SHT36 V3 is a tool board designed by Guangzhou Mellow Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. for 3D printer extruder heads, which can replace the complex wiring between the motherboard and the print head with four wires, optimizing the layout. SHT36 V3 is suitable for 36 stepper motors and integrates features such as a CAN transceiver, RS232 transceiver, TypeC port, TMC2209 driver, LIS2DW accelerometer sensor, two controllable fans, and more. This tool board is compatible with Klipper and RRF firmware.

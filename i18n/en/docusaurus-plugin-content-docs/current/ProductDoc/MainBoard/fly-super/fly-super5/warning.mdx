# Mainboard Precautions

## Power Indicator

        <ImageView image={require('@site/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super5/img/power.webp').default} size="80%" align="center" />
    * When powered only through TYPE-C without connecting to other power sources on the motherboard, at least two lights `3.3V` and `5V` should be lit.
    * After connecting the motherboard power, the motherboard power light should illuminate `3.3V`, `5V`, and `12V`.
    * The power indicator light on the lower left of the motherboard will light up normally after the drive power 0-2, drive power 3-7, and heated bed power are connected.

### Troubleshooting


    :::danger Notice

    * In the absence of any external devices (drivers, limit switches, 12864, etc.)
    * When powered only through TYPE-C, at least two LEDs `3.3V` and `5V` should remain constantly lit.

    :::

    * If `3.3V` and `5V` do not light up, check the motherboard's 5V jumper.
    * If the issue persists after changing the jumper and confirming that the type-c is supplying power normally, contact customer service for support.
    * If one of the `3.3V` or `5V` lights is blinking, it indicates a short circuit in a chip, requiring contact with customer service for support.

## Drivers
    * Driver power supply can use 48V but all drivers must use 48V.
    * The motherboard supports external drivers     <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/ModuleDrive/servo-drive">Wiring and Configuration Guide</Button>

## Limit Switch Ports

    * If the limit switch ports are not functioning, consider replacing the limit switch port or trimming the driver's limit switch foot.

## Firmware Flashing

    * The motherboard uses TF card for flashing.
    * Due to tutorial issues, DFU was previously used for flashing. If you need to update the firmware, you need to <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="/docs/ProductDoc/MainBoard/fly-super/fly-super8-pro/flash/bl">re-flash BL</Button>.

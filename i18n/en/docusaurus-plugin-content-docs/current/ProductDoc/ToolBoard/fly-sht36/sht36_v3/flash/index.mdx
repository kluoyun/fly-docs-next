    :::tip

    * The SHT36 V3 comes with the Katapult firmware pre-flashed for the CAN connection at a rate of 1M.
    * The Katapult firmware for the SHT36 V3 CAN connection has rates of 500K and 1M; you can flash it yourself if needed.

# Firmware Burning Instructions
    
    * Both firmware compilation and firmware burning require an upper computer.
    * SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper computer via RS232 or CAN.
    * RS232 and CAN need to use `XT30(2+2)-F` for connection.
    * Below is the style of the `XT30(2+2)-F` data cable.

:::danger Note
* Mainboard firmware burning needs to burn Klipper through Katapult.
* If you are sure that the mainboard has already been burned with Katapult, you do not need to perform the last Katapult firmware burning, as that is just a precaution in case the Katapult firmware burning on the mainboard was unsuccessful.
* You can quickly press reset twice to see if a LED on the motherboard flashes. If there is one, it indicates that the motherboard has entered the Katapult firmware.

## How to Determine Which Firmware You Need

    * SHT36 V3 can connect to the upper computer using the following methods:
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./can">CAN Firmware</Button>
        * Advantage: If you flash the `Katapult` firmware, you can update the firmware without touching the motherboard, and it supports bus connections.
        * Disadvantage: There may be errors such as homing timeout when used together with `KlipperScreen`.
        * Tip: If you need to use CAN, make sure the upper computer supports CAN and pair it with UTOC or a motherboard with bridge firmware flashed.
    * <Button variant="contained" disableElevation href="./rs232">RS232 Firmware</Button>
        * Advantage: No special software is required, communication is reliable and stable.
        * Disadvantage: Re-flashing the firmware requires entering manual DFU mode to update the firmware or double-clicking RST to enter `Katapult` to update the firmware.
        * Tip: It needs to be paired with G2T or UTOR to work.
